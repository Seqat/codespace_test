# codespace_test

This repository is a test bench for me to learn how to use Github Codespace.
When I first started using Github Codespace, I was not sure how to use it.
So I created this repository to test how to use it. So far, I started to
learn Rust, and I am still learning Rust as I write this repositories README file.
I hope that I can use Github Codespace to learn Rust.
