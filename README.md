# Codespace_test: Every Giant learning path starts with a small code

## Introduction
This repository is a test bench for me to learn how to use Github Codespace.
When I first started using Github Codespace, I was not sure how to use it.
So I created this repository to test how to use it. So far, I started to
learn Rust, and I am still learning Rust as I write this repositories README file.
I hope that I can use Github Codespace to learn Rust.

First, I started to learn the basics of Rust like how datatypes work or how to use the `println!` macro. Then, I try to understand how to take input from the user with the std::io::stdin() function. I think this i≈ü will be a good way to learn how to use Github Codespace.
